In this report, I give a general introduction to ontologies by describing some main topics. I describe the origin of the word "ontology" and give some main definitions of the word for our use. The motivation, or needs, for developing and using ontologies is a main part and both practical use and reasons for use are treated. I have given ways to engineer better ontologies and ways to evaluate ontologies. In the end I give two examples for practical usage. I have read and learned a lot about ontologies. A main understanding is that no 100\% correct ontology is, or will be, created.The more useful an ontology would be, the closer to impossible it is going to be make it.
